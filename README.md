# <div align = center>Local SC-FC coupling pattern</div>

**Subgraph extraction** is based on deep coding tree and gSpan algorithm.

### Data availability statement
The data is not publicly available due to permission reasons. The data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

### Counterfactual Explanation
The counterfactual interpretation based on local SC-FC coupling is based on the DiCE framework. For more details, please visit: https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE.
